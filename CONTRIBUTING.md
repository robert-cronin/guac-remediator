# Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please open issues for bugs or feature requests. Submit PRs with tests and follow standard Go formatting and linting guidelines.

## Code Style
- Use `go fmt`
- Add unit tests for new features

## Branching & Releases
- Use feature branches, open PRs against `main`.
- Release versions are tagged after a stable set of features are merged.
